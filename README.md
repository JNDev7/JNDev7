I'm Jeremy, a student in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I am proficient in Java and Kotlin, and familiar with C. At the moment, I enjoy simple game engine development and discord bot creation; however, I wish to explore beyond these in the future and look into 3D game development, robotics, and possibly web development. Aside from my programming interests, I also have a slight interest in graphic design and 3D modeling. On my GitHub profile, you will find only my personal projects, so no school work or similar projects. Thank you for visiting my profile!
