Hey, I'm Jeremy, a student in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I am proficient in Java and know basic C. Generally, my projects revolve around game development. My most popular repository, Pseudo3D, is a 2.5D game engine written in Java. Most of my older projects are Minecraft Spigot server plugins. I wish to go beyond all of these in the future and explore web development, 3D game development, and robotics.
