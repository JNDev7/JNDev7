I'm Jeremy, a student in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I am proficient in Java and Kotlin, and familiar with C. At the moment, I enjoy simple game development and discord bots; however, I wish to explore beyond these in the future and look into 3D game development, robotics, and possibly web development. Aside from my programming interests, I also have an interest in graphic design and 3D modeling.
