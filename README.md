Hey, I'm Jeremy, a student in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I'm proficient in Java, picking up Kotlin, and familiar with C. At the moment, I enjoy simple game development and discord bots; however, I wish to explore beyond these in the future and look into web development, 3D game development, and robotics.
