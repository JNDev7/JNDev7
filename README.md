# About Me

Hey, I'm Jeremy! I'm a student studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I am proficient in Java, know basic C, and am learning JavaScript. Generally, my projects revolve around game development. My most popular repository, Pseudo3D, is a 2.5D game engine written in Java. A handful of my other projects are Minecraft Spigot server plugins. Some university projects may also be found here. I wish to go beyond all of these in the future and explore web development, 3D game development, and robotics.

# About My Repos

In repositories under my account, you will find three branches:<br>
• development - changes often and most up-to-date, not guaranteed to work or even compile<br>
• stable - changes less often, most likely compiles and works, partially tested, not polished<br>
• release - changes infrequently, guaranteed to work, tested, polished, may also have published releases
