# Hey, I'm Jeremy

![Banner](https://i.imgur.com/qRio593.png)

I am a student studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I am proficient in Java, know basic C, and have dabbled in JavaScript. I mainly develop Minecraft server plugins, but I also have a couple projects that deal with simple game development. I wish to go beyond just Minecraft and basic game development in the future and explore web development, 3D game development, and robotics. Most of my repositories are just for fun and are personal projects. Occasionally, you will find some of my school projects here. Feel free to look around!
