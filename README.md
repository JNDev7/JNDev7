# Hey, I'm Jeremy! ðŸ‘‹

I am a student studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I know Java, as well as a little bit of C and JavaScript. I mainly write Minecraft server plugins, but I also enjoy other projects related to game development. I wish to go beyond just Minecraft and game development in the future and explore web development and robotics. Most of my repositories are just for fun, personal projects. Occasionally, you will find some of my school projects here!
