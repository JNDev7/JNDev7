# Hey, I'm Jeremy

![Banner](https://i.imgur.com/qRio593.png)

I'm a student studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I am proficient in Java, know basic C, and am learning JavaScript. I mainly develop Minecraft server plugins, but I also have other projects involving simple game development and random ideas. I wish to go beyond Minecraft plugins and basic game development in the future and explore web development, 3D game development, and robotics. 

Most of my repositories are just for fun, personal projects. Occasionally, you will find some of my school projects here.
